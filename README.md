## Apple Juice esp32 [[Rolandstoner's repo](https://github.com/ronaldstoner/AppleJuice-ESP32)] with I2C Oled Integration
* Most of the code is copied, not my work.
* You can use this to just look cooler, it shows the info and number of brodcased devices :D
### There is not much to say, just have fun messing with your üçé friends. But still make sure they dont understand :P

## Instalation
Easiest way to flash it to your board will be through PlatformIO in visual studio code.

I recomend using this ESP32 ESP-WROOM-32. [Ali link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005178736422.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2isr). Any thing will work just make sure that you change the pins in the code.
